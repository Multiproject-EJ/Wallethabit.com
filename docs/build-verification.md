# Build Verification (2024-04-05)

Commands executed inside `/app`:

1. `ping -c 1 registry.npmjs.org` → network still unavailable in container (`Network is unreachable`).
2. `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` → dependency tree already up to date.
3. `npm run build` → Vite build succeeded and emitted assets to `dist/`.
4. Verified `dist/index.html` exists.

Result: the Vite production bundle is produced successfully within the workspace environment.
