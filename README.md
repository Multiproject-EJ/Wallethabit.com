This repository contains planning and assets for the upcoming Modular Personal Finance Suite project.

## Product Planning Documentation

- [Product Plan â€“ Part 1](docs/PRODUCT_PLAN_PART1.md): Comprehensive vision, modules, UX principles, architecture outline, monetization strategy, and roadmap for the modular personal finance platform. Keep this document intact as the authoritative reference until Part 2 is added.

Future updates (including Part 2 of the product plan and technical specifications) should be stored alongside this documentation so that subsequent development cycles can reference the complete history.
