# Modular Personal Finance Suite — Product Plan (Part 1 of 2)

This document captures the first installment of the product vision and planning details for the Modular Personal Finance Suite. Future updates (e.g., Part 2) should expand upon this foundation without altering the historical context provided here.

## 1. Product Vision

A modular personal finance suite that evolves with the user’s financial journey. It starts as a simple budgeting app and grows into a comprehensive “financial operating system” as needed – similar to a Notion for money. The core application provides an all-in-one dashboard overview of finances (income, expenses, net worth, goals) and lets users selectively activate additional modules (Debt, Investments, Side Hustles, Real Estate, etc.) as their lives become more complex. This ensures the interface stays uncluttered, showing only what’s relevant to each user. The product emphasizes clean, modern design (mobile-first but responsive on desktop) and prioritizes security and privacy for sensitive financial data (e.g. end-to-end encryption, 2FA).

Proposed tech stack:
- **Frontend:** A web application (React, Vue, or Svelte) that is mobile-friendly and can be wrapped as a hybrid mobile app if needed.
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres database + authentication API) for data storage and user authentication.
- **APIs/Integrations:** Optional Open Banking integrations (e.g., Plaid) for account syncing and AI services for intelligent insights when premium features are enabled.
- **Payment Infrastructure:** Stripe for managing subscriptions or one-time purchases of premium modules.

Vision highlights: a personalized, extensible platform that starts simple for novices and scales to advanced needs while maintaining trust, ease of use, and visual appeal. The tone remains empowering and friendly, helping users feel in control of their money.

## 2. Core Dashboard (Base Module)

The central dashboard is always enabled and aggregates data from all active modules:
- **Net Worth Timeline:** Interactive chart tracking assets minus liabilities over time.
- **Cash Flow Heatmap:** Calendar or heatmap visualizing income vs. expenses each month.
- **Budget Overview:** Category-based spending breakdown with planned vs. actual comparisons.
- **Goal Tracker:** Progress indicators for financial goals (e.g., emergency fund completion).
- **Quick Actions:** Shortcuts for frequent tasks (add expense/income, log assets, connect accounts).
- **Notifications & Insights:** Tips and alerts tailored to user activity; basic rule-based insights for free users and AI-enhanced insights for premium users.

Users can personalize the dashboard by reordering or hiding sections to keep the interface relevant to their needs.

## 3. Add-On Modules (Enable As Needed)

## 7. Technical Specification & File Structure (High-Level)

### Frontend (React example)
```
/src
├── components
│   ├── Dashboard.jsx

```
Edge functions handle secure operations such as Stripe webhooks, Plaid sync, AI insight generation, and complex calculations.

### Database Schema (Initial)
- `users`: id, email, name, currency, preferences, created_at.
- `accounts`: id, user_id, name, type, balance, institution.
- `transactions`: id, user_id, account_id, date, payee, amount, category, module_tag, notes.
- `budgets`, `debts`, `assets`, `goals`, `modules_enabled`, `insights` (plus module-specific tables as needed).

### State Management & Testing
