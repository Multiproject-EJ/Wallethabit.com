# Product Research â€” WalletHabit

Focus:
- High-impact features users love and pay for
- UX that builds clarity + momentum
- Fair monetization (free, premium, lifetime)
- Prioritization: what to build first

Notes align with best practices from YNAB/Monarch/Copilot:
- Fast onboarding, helpful defaults
- Visual dashboards that tell progress stories
- Automation: categories, reminders, goals
- Debt payoff coaching: snowball/avalanche playbooks with celebratory nudges
- Bank syncing: Plaid-first launch, optional aggregators (Finicity/MX) for coverage depth
- Embedded education + AI summaries
- Personalisation controls early to build trust (plans, locale, notifications)
