# WalletHabit Site Assessment

## Alignment with Original Product Vision
- **Modular surface area is well represented in navigation.** The live shell exposes every planned lab (budget, debt, income, investments, retirement, protection, tax, estate, AI, security) as independent routes, matching the "Notion for money" module philosophy described in the research. The layout shows 17 nav links that mirror the planned modules, ensuring the UI scaffolding exists for each future feature.【F:app/src/components/Layout.tsx†L1-L55】
- **Narrative and copy reinforce the staged rollout.** The homepage clearly communicates that the foundation is present while auth, data, and payments are upcoming, echoing the "start simple, scale later" goal from the product vision.【F:app/src/pages/Home.tsx†L1-L86】【F:docs/product_research.md†L1-L24】
- **Individual labs preview the intended experiences.** Pages such as the budget planner, debt lab, and integrations blueprint include interactive sandboxes and milestone checklists that align with the prioritization logic captured in the original research (e.g., debt snowball vs. avalanche, Plaid-first bank sync).【F:app/src/pages/Budget.tsx†L1-L162】【F:app/src/pages/Debt.tsx†L1-L116】【F:app/src/pages/Integrations.tsx†L1-L132】

## Current Completion Snapshot
- **Front-end shell (~70% complete).** The README self-reports a 72% overall build with nearly complete UI/UX coverage, which matches the presence of polished React/Tailwind pages for each module.【F:README.md†L9-L24】
- **Interactive prototypes without persistence.** Core planners (budget envelopes, goals, debt scenarios) allow local adjustments but rely solely on in-memory state. There is no Supabase persistence yet, so data resets on refresh and multi-device use is impossible.【F:app/src/pages/Budget.tsx†L63-L162】【F:app/src/pages/Goals.tsx†L1-L116】
- **Integrations and monetization still placeholders.** Environment checks gate Supabase and Stripe usage, but no keys are configured, so auth, bank syncing, and checkout flows remain inactive. CTA messaging correctly flags the missing secrets.【F:app/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts†L1-L28】【F:app/src/lib/stripeClient.ts†L1-L14】【F:app/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx†L71-L116】
- **Roadmap tracking aligns with reality.** The TODO lists remaining work for CI, status pages, and production integrations, reinforcing that most shipping blockers are backend/devops rather than UI.【F:TODO.md†L1-L32】

## Gaps vs. Target Experience
- **No real data connectivity.** Without Supabase tables, Plaid token exchange, or Stripe products, the "financial operating system" vision cannot yet manage real accounts, sync transactions, or enforce paywalls.【F:app/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts†L1-L28】【F:app/src/pages/Integrations.tsx†L96-L132】
- **AI assistant is copy-only.** The navigation includes an AI copilot, but there is no model wiring, prompt execution, or data analysis hooks, leaving a major differentiator unimplemented (page content is currently static copy explaining future behavior).【F:app/src/components/Layout.tsx†L3-L26】【F:app/src/pages/Assistant.tsx†L1-L160】
- **Lack of authentication and user settings persistence.** The settings page references future plan and locale controls, yet no auth routes or Supabase profile tables exist, preventing personalization or module toggling per user.【F:app/src/pages/Settings.tsx†L1-L160】【F:app/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts†L1-L28】
- **Testing, linting, and CI absent.** The TODO highlights missing ESLint, Vitest, and CI health checks, leaving quality gates off and increasing risk when dynamic features arrive.【F:TODO.md†L33-L48】

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Bootstrap Supabase schemas and auth** to unlock persistent budgets, goals, and module toggles. Start with `profiles`, `envelopes`, `goals`, and RLS policies so current planners can hydrate real data.【F:app/src/lib/supabaseClient.ts†L1-L28】【F:docs/product_research.md†L1-L24】
2. **Integrate Plaid sandbox via Supabase Edge Functions** following the checklist already outlined in the integrations lab, enabling genuine transaction imports to power dashboards and AI insights.【F:app/src/pages/Integrations.tsx†L40-L132】
3. **Wire Stripe pricing tiers** to transition from static pricing copy to enforceable upgrade flows, gating premium labs (AI, investments) once functionality ships.【F:app/src/lib/stripeClient.ts†L1-L14】【F:README.md†L17-L24】
4. **Stand up testing and CI** (ESLint, Vitest, GitHub Actions) to protect the growing surface area before backend statefulness adds complexity.【F:TODO.md†L33-L48】
5. **Prototype AI insights on mocked data** to prove the Copilot value prop. Even a scripted monthly report generated client-side would validate UX prior to full data access.【F:app/src/pages/Assistant.tsx†L1-L160】

Overall, the site delivers a polished design prototype that maps closely to the modular finance OS vision, but functional completeness remains in the 30% range because core data, auth, AI, and payments infrastructure are still to be implemented.
