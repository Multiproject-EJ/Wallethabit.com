# Codex-First Workflow Overview

1. **Plan in the README**
   - Treat `README.md` as the living hub.
   - Update roadmap checkboxes and references after each meaningful change.

2. **Collaborate via Codex**
   - Request end-to-end solutions from Codex for clarity.
   - Validate outputs before committing.

3. **Automate with GitHub Actions**
   - Use CI to build and deploy the `app/` folder automatically.
   - Keep workflows simple, modular, and environment-aware.

4. **Document Continuously**
   - Store research, specs, and monetization notes in `docs/`.
   - Reference long-form documents from the README for quick access.

5. **Iterate and Reflect**
   - Review action logs, capture learnings in docs, and adjust roadmap priorities.
